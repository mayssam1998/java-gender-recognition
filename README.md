# Gender Recognition with JavaCV (CNN)

Gender recognition using openCV’s fisherfaces implementation is quite popular and some of you may have tried or read about it also. But, in example, I will be using a different approach to recognize gender. This method was introduced by two Israel researchers, Gil Levi and Tal Hassner in 2015. I have used the CNN models trained by them in this example. We are going to use the OpenCV’s dnn package which stands for “Deep Neural Networks”.
